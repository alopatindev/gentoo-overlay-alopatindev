# This release bundles Dart SDK 3.13.3 (see dart_sdk_version in upstream's
# releases_linux.json). src_install replaces the bundled SDK with the system
# one, so the version must match exactly: bin/cache/flutter_tools.snapshot only
# loads on the Dart VM it was compiled against. Keep this pin in sync with the
# dart_sdk_version of ${PV}, and keep the matching dev-lang/dart ebuild in the
# tree even after dart is bumped.
#
# The pin is what the revision is for: .autoupdate bumps PV without reading
# RDEPEND, so every bump arrives carrying the PREVIOUS release's pin and merges
# against a Dart the snapshot was not built on. A plain edit would not reinstall
# it -- only a revbump does. This is the second time the same bump did the same
# thing: 3.47.2 needed -r1 (5810abcc9), and 3.47.3 landed in 941ba854d still
# pinning 3.13.2 while upstream had moved the stable channel to 3.13.3 on
# 2026-09-09. Treat a flutter bump as unfinished until this line is re-derived
# from the source, never from the changelog:
#
#   curl -s 'https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/releases_linux.json' \
#     | jq -r '.releases[] | select(.channel=="stable") | "\(.version)\t\(.dart_sdk_version)"' | head
#
# acct-group/flutter is a DEPEND as well as an RDEPEND: src_install calls
# fowners, and the fowners helper resolves the group name against
# ${ESYSROOT}/etc/group, so the group has to exist at build time.

DOC_CONTENTS="The Flutter SDK is installed in /opt/flutter.

Unlike an ordinary program, the flutter tool writes into its own SDK tree on
every single invocation: it stamps bin/cache/, takes a lock there, downloads
platform artifacts on demand, populates packages/flutter_tools/.dart_tool/,
and runs 'git fetch' in the bundled repository. A read-only tree is therefore
not merely limited, it does not work at all.

That tree is owned by the 'flutter' group and is group-writable. To use
flutter, add yourself to that group and start a new login session:

    gpasswd -a <user> flutter

Note the consequence: every member of the 'flutter' group can modify the SDK
that the other members execute. Add only users you would trust with that.

Do NOT copy /opt/flutter into your home directory as a way around the group.
bin/cache/dart-sdk is an absolute symlink to /usr/lib/dart, so a copy stays
bound to whatever dev-lang/dart is installed system-wide. The next dart bump
leaves the copy's flutter_tools.snapshot compiled against the previous Dart
VM, and every command then fails with:

    Wrong full snapshot version, expected '<new>' found '<old>'

Only the tree installed by this package is kept in step with dev-lang/dart,
because the ebuild pins the exact Dart version the SDK was built against."
